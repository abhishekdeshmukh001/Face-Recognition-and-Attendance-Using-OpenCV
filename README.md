> Implementing a real-time face recognition and attendance system using OpenCV, Dlib, and advanced machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction

This project aims to create a robust face recognition and attendance system utilizing the power of OpenCV, Dlib, and advanced machine learning algorithms. The system can identify individuals in real-time video streams, recognize their faces, and keep track of attendance using a user-friendly interface.

The Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) face recognizer is utilized to identify faces in the video stream. The system also employs Pycharm as the integrated development environment and Excel for maintaining attendance records.

## Features

- Real-time face recognition using the LBPH face recognizer.
- User-friendly interface for monitoring and managing attendance.
- Integration with Pycharm for streamlined development.
- Excel integration for attendance record-keeping.
- Utilizes Dlib for accurate facial landmarks detection.
- Incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms for improved recognition.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- PyCharm (or any other preferred IDE)
- Excel (for attendance records)
